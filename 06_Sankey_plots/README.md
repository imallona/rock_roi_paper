# Aim
Generation of Sankey plots representing read flows for the two mixing experiments
 
# .qmd files and corresponding figure panels
**Sankey_second_mixing.qmd:** code to calculate total number of counts and on-target unique and multimapper values for second mixing experiment
**Sankey_first_mixing.qmd:** code to calculate total number of counts and on-target unique and multimapper values for first mixing experiment
**rock_second_mixing_sankey.sh:** code to calculate values based on BAM files for the rock condition in the second mixing experiment 
**rockroi_second_mixing_sankey.sh:** code to calculate values based on BAM files for the rockroi condition in the second mixing experiment                        
**unmod_n1.sh:** code to calculate values based on BAM files for hte unmod_n1 condition in the first mixing experiment
**unmod_roi_second_mixing_sankey.sh:** code to calculate values based on BAM files for the unmod_roi condition in the second mixing experiment
**unmod_second_mixing_sankey.sh:** code to calculate values based on BAM files for the unmod condition in the second mixing experiment
