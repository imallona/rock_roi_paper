# Aim

- `00_mixing`: mouse + human cell mixing experiment, with GFP and tdTomato as captures. Aim: testing the RoCK and ROI library generation
- `01_pdgfra_experiment`: the mouse experiment with chr5 PDGFRA and GFP captures
- `03_first_mixing_experiment`: mouse + human cell mixing experiment, with GFP and tdTomato as captures. Aim: testing the addition of T primer during library generation
- `05_facs_plots`: analysis of FACS plots from RoCKseq bead modification
- `06_Sankey_plots`: code to generate Sankey plots for the two mixing experiments
