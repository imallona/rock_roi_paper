# Aim

Supplementary code for _RoCK and ROI: a single-cell RNA-sequencing method with enhanced transcriptome information via targeted enrichment of transcripts and preselected, region-specific sequencing_.

[Preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.18.594120).

# Structure

- `00_mixing`: mouse + human cell mixing experiment, with GFP and tdTomato as captures. Aim: testing the RoCK and ROI library generation
- `01_pdgfra_experiment`: the mouse experiment with chr5 PDGFRA and GFP captures
- `03_first_mixing_experiment`: mouse + human cell mixing experiment, with GFP and tdTomato as captures. Aim: testing the addition of T primer during library generation
- `05_facs_plots`: analysis of FACS plots from RoCKseq bead modification
- `06_Sankey_plots`: code to generate Sankey plots for the two mixing experiments
- `07_leukemia_patient`: deprecated analysis of BCR-ABL patient data 
- `08_leukemia_cell_lines`: deprecated analysis of BCR-ABL cell line mixing experiment
- `10_troubleshooting`: artificially primed products (APP) documentation

# Branches

- `leukemia`-related: leukemia usecases
- `troubleshooting`: extra QCs and checks across experiments
